# FinSight Landing (Vite + React)

This workspace adds a minimal Vite + React setup to run the existing `index.jsx` React component as a single-page app.

How to run:

1. Open a terminal in the project root (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "d:\Projects\neuronexus\landing page"; npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- This setup uses the CDN Tailwind CSS import for simplicity. For a production build, integrate Tailwind properly.
- If you prefer yarn or pnpm, adjust the commands accordingly.
